# **JAVASCRIPT HISTORY**
JavaScript is everywhere, and for the seventh year in a row, it has been ranked the most commonly used programming language, with 67.8% of developers employing it in 2019. Its ascent to the world’s most popular programming language is synonymous with the rise of the internet itself.

Created out of necessity, it is used to build 95.2% (1.52 billion) of websites today, including some of the world’s largest, like Facebook and YouTube. Without it, we would not have popular and useful web apps such as Google Maps and eBay. 

The early to mid-1990s was an important time for the internet. Key players like Netscape and Microsoft were in the midst of browser wars, with Netscape’s Navigator and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer going head to head.

In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named Brandan Eich developed a new scripting language in just 10 days. It was originally named Mocha, but quickly became known as LiveScript and, later, JavaScript.

# **DATATYPES IN JS**
JavaScript variables can hold many data types:
* String
* Number
* Object
* Boolean
* Null
* Undefined
* Symbol

### **Strings**
A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

### **Numbers**
JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.

### **Objects**
A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects.

### **Boolean**
A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.

### **Null**
In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.
Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.

### **Undefined**
In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.

# **FUNCTIONS IN JS**
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

```javascript
function demoFunc() {
  console.log("Hello World"):
}
```
